# Spotify Song Suggester API

[Product Vision Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnAeTMPiyoDOr_WhCDBgnm--AFyRnsOspLgMVkamS08/edit)

[Plotly Dash](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2/dash-template/) was used to suggest spotify songs based on a 
track_id chosen by the user. 

The API uses a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).

A K-Nearest Neighbors model was integrated into the app to handle the requests and return the appropriate JSON data.
